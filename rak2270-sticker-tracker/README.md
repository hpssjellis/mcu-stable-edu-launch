Software
The main chip used on the RAK2270 is the WisDuo Module RAK3172-SiP/RAK3172LP-SiP (pin-to-pin and software compatible). This chip has STM32WL SoC which is a combination of MCU and LoRa/SubGhz transceiver. 
The firmware written on this is based on [RUI3](https://docs.rakwireless.com/RUI3/). You can start creating your own firmware using this [RAK3172-SiP guide](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK3172-SiP/Quickstart/#rak3172-sip-as-a-stand-alone-device-using-rui3).
