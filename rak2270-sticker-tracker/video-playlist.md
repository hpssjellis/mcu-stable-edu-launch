The plan is to have a playlist of small videos showing specific things in the big tutorial

Video playlist notes:

# Rakwireless playlist of playlists. 

This playlist simply goes to the entry point for each of the other playlists tutorials


# RAK2270StickerTracker (All short videos)

Full coverage of the main sticker tracker. Every video


1. removing label
1. unsolder positive terminal of battery
1. 3D Print latest rig
1. hot glue the pin holes on the rig and scrape off the extra (indent holes if you can). This is easier than re-melting the 3D print
1. push in pogoPins from the top using soldering gun to heat pins
1. line up pins (this is difficult)
1. Check if all pins can be squished, attach elestic bands to cause pressure.
1. For USB TTL serial monitoring and programming over serial attach GND, RX, TX and 3.3V an Arduino can output 3.3V for you. <hr>

 
1. Connect the RAK2270StickerTracker with USB TTL monitor setup and working and check the Arduino Serial monitor output
