I tried on Windows with the old Arduino IDE 1.8.1 and it the board would not even install.

I tired on Linux with version 1.8.15 and it installed fine but the examples did not show up.


I tired on 2 of my school computers Arduino IDE version 2.2.x and it installed fine but with only half of the examples.


I tired on my home Windows with Arduino Version 2.2.x and it installed fine with all examples


I am trying on Linux with Arduino IDE version 2.2.x ...
